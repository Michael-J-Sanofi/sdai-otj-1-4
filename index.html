    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by day and cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions and create something extraordinary.
